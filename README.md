# Ôçô Hyprland Dotfiles

This is the configuration I am currently using for Hyprland
I have tried many dots in the past and I liked them but not ALL of what each one offered so I decided to make my own config
I have borrowed some code from the dots I like (especially JaKoolIt) but have also added my own spin on some things

I have also made an install script that should install everything nicely (I even left in the dry-run command just so you can see exactly what it is doing)

I have added some wallpapers I've collected (will probably add more as I go)

Applauncher (rofi)

Powermenu (JaKoolIt)

Install:
```bash
git pull https://github.com/daigonstar/hyprland-dots.git
cd hyprland-dots/hyprdots
./hyprinstall.sh
```
